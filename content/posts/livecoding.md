title: Livecoding
---

As a livecoder, I have performed at algoraves as a musician namely and visualist more recently. I have performed live using TidalCycles, SuperCollider, Hydra, and Strudel. 

Here are some algoraves that I hosted:
  - [LivecodeNYC Salonrave @ Caffeine Underground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRX1xRuI-no)
  - [Livecode NYC Presents Vibration Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbz2SjlaV5s)
  - [Process is Power Livecode.NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QsXvUIJWk)
  - [Algogayze Livecode Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5W9w2vR-z8)
  - [not recorded] Open Cables, a livecode open mic night at Caffeine Underground.
  - [Algorave Atlanta, GA](https://data-dancers.github.io/algoraving/)   


I want more people to be livecode performers too, so create environments that support this goal. I helped LivecodeNYC gain monthly invitation to host meetups at Brooklyn Public Library. I have created a variety of free public livecode workshops. And I created a livecode community in Atlanta, GA. 

Here are two docs I wrote that were presented at livecode meetups.
