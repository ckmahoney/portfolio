## Performances

As a livecoder, I have performed at algoraves both as a musician and, more recently, as a visualist. I have used TidalCycles, SuperCollider, Hydra, and Strudel in my performances.

### Hosted Algoraves

Here are some algoraves that I hosted:
  - [LivecodeNYC Salonrave @ Caffeine Underground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRX1xRuI-no)
  - [Livecode NYC Presents Vibration Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbz2SjlaV5s)
  - [Process is Power Livecode.NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6QsXvUIJWk)
  - [Algogayze Livecode Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5W9w2vR-z8)
  - Open Cables, a livecode open mic night at Caffeine Underground [Not recorded] 
  - [Algorave Atlanta, GA](https://data-dancers.github.io/algoraving/)

## Documentation

Here are two documents I wrote that were presented at livecode workshops:

{{< gdoc title="how-to-make-a-synthesizer" id="1xmw1-QVdJ_2qoyMiA3cY4b9fHu8BKq4I2aHhdMMkJGc" >}}

{{< gdoc title="Artistic Infinity Mirrors with Hydra" id="1oscw6f04gKoJFT1YQzee9cv_A3vzJXzZYiwKn4N1IBE" >}}


## Community Building

With LivecodeNYC, I helped dozens of artists get their first experience performing livecoding. I empowered people to express themselves through handwritten technology. 

With Data Dancers, I built the community from scratch. There was no livecoding group in Atlanta before I arrived, and now we have a core group of six members/contributors and a dozen peripheral attendees.

## Personal Reflections

Livecoding blurs the lines between art and technology. It offers software developers a new way to express themselves and helps artists reshape their understanding of music and art. And it's so fun!

## Technical Insights (Opinions)

- **TidalCycles:** My favorite for making fun music, with a great high-level API for patterning music, sound, and effects parameters. Most of my "good" livecode music sets are with TidalCycles.

- **SuperCollider:** Offers more manual control but can be harder to use in real-time for variety. A simple comparison is that TidalCycles is like JavaScript, while SuperCollider is like C.

- **Hydra:** Recently my tool of choice, especially since most Data Dancers prefer musical tools. It helps me think about transformations over space and time in new ways.

- **Strudel:** A tool I know just enough about to teach to others. It shares a pattern syntax with TidalCycles but runs in the browser, making it more accessible without needing to install Haskell, SuperCollider, and an IDE.
