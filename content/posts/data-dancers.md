title: Data Dancers
--- 

While in New York City I organized some algoraves as well as livecode workshops. When I moved to Atlanta, life felt emptier without this livecode environment. I used meetup dot com to find other people with an interest in live coding and we started Data Dancers. Sometimes it is hard to find a public place to meet where we can project screens or make noise but it is worth it. I love introducing new meetup attendees to Strudel and Hydra as entrypoints. It often blows their minds and is also accessible for them to start coding music or art immediately. Our first algorave was September 15th, and I've helped these community members learn how to contact venues and book events. My goal is to help teach sustainable community practices so that it can grow and thrive indefinitely. 

## Hackathon

After 12 months of monthly meetups at a variety of locations, it was becoming difficult to convey to curious new people what/where/how we do stuff. To solve this, I hosted a 3 day hackathon at my house in Stone Mountain, GA. 3 coders came over in person, and two participants contributed remotely in this timeframe. 

From Friday to Sunday, we went through the entire software development lifecycle:
  - Planning and ideation on Friday
  - Setting requirements and nice-to-haves
  - Determing ACL, hosting provider, and ownership
  - Determing contributing guidelines
  - Selecting technologies 
  - Selecting deployment method 
  - Designing the website and pages
  - Building the wireframe of the site
  - Code sprints and loud music
  - Check ins, peer review, and testing of work
  - Sharing homemade vegetarian gluten free meals once a day 
  - Final publication of the new website on Sunday

## Community 

It is working! At the time of writing, one community member has organized the next algorave September 2024; and another member is working on a followup show November 2024.
