## Introduction

While in New York City, I organized algoraves and livecode workshops. After moving to Atlanta, I felt the absence of this vibrant livecode environment. Using Meetup.com, I found others interested in live coding and started Data Dancers. 

Though finding public spaces to meet and project screens or make noise can be challenging, it is always worthwhile. 

I enjoy introducing new members to Strudel and Hydra, which often blows their minds and provides an accessible entry point to coding music or art immediately.

## First Algorave and Community Growth

Our first algorave took place on September 15th, 2024. View footage [here](https://data-dancers.github.io/algoraving/)!Since then, I have helped community members learn how to contact venues and book events. 

My goal is to teach sustainable community practices, allowing the group to grow and thrive indefinitely.

## Hackathon

After 12 months of monthly meetups in various locations, it became challenging to explain what we do to newcomers. To address this, I hosted a 3-day hackathon at my house in Stone Mountain, GA. We had 3 in-person coders and 2 remote participants. Over the weekend, we followed the entire software development lifecycle:

- **Planning** and ideation on Friday
- Setting **requirements** and nice-to-haves
- Determining ACL, hosting provider, and **ownership**
- Establishing **contributing** guidelines
- Selecting technologies and deployment method
- Designing the website and **pages**
- Building the **wireframe** of the site
- **Code sprints** with loud music
- Peer reviews, testing, and daily homemade vegetarian **gluten-free** meals
- Final publication of the new website on **Sunday**


You can see the website we created during the hackathon [here](https://data-dancers.github.io/). This site also features event history, including workshops.

## Ongoing Community Success

The community is thriving! One member has organized the next algorave in September 2024, and another is planning a follow-up show for November 2024.

Through organizing these events, I learned:

- **Engagement:** How to improve my interactions with new meetup attendees, making them feel warmly welcomed and involved.
- **Communication:**
  - **Non-Technical:** Improved communication to non-technical to understand JavaScript 101, enabling them to use it immediately for editing art in the browser.
  - **Technical:** Assisted experienced users by directing them to documentation, examples templates and presets for Hydra/Strudel, and additional livecoding tools and resources.
- **Event Organization:** How to ask for help in organizing public events, which creates a better sense of collaboration and community.
