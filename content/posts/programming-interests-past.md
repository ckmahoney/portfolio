title: Programming Interests (past)
---

While I was teaching myself how to write code and build software, there were a number of topics that were compelling. This brief list are my favorite ones. I don't want to spend time right now writing about these topics in depth. You can book a consultation call with me if it is important to you. Happy to describe in better detail any of these.

  - Functional Programming (Hindley-Milner & Lisps)
  - Emacs
  - Desktop Ubuntu
  - TypeScript
  - Website and application development
  - Publishing projects for like 6 months

Here are three programming books that I have read and learned a lot from:

  - The C Book by Mike Banahan, Declan Brady and Mark Doran
  - Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja, by John Resig, Bear Bibeault, and Josip Maras
  - Clojure for the Brave and True, by Daniel Higginbotham
