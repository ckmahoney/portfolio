title: Programming Interests (Past)

## Autodidactic Journey

As a self-taught engineer, my journey of learning to code and build software was driven by curiosity and a commitment to mastering the craft independently. Several topics stood out as particularly compelling during this time. While I won't dive into them in depth here, Iâ€™m happy to discuss any of them in detail through a consultation. Here are my favorite past programming interests:

- Functional Programming (Hindley-Milner & Lisps)
- Emacs
- Desktop Ubuntu
- TypeScript
- Website and application development
- Publishing projects for six months

## Good books

Here are three programming books that I learned a lot by reading and following along with a repl or compiler:

- *The C Book* by Mike Banahan, Declan Brady, and Mark Doran
- *Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja* by John Resig, Bear Bibeault, and Josip Maras
- *Clojure for the Brave and True* by Daniel Higginbotham
